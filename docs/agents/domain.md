# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/ADR/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md          ← created lazily by /domain-modeling
├── docs/ADR/
│   └── ADR-0001-initial.md
├── docs/internals/     ← index, common, webapp
├── docs/rules/         ← index; common + per application
├── docs/specs/
├── Zat.Tests.Runner.Common/
├── Zat.Tests.Runner.Common.Net/
├── Zat.Tests.Runner.TuiApp/
├── Zat.Tests.Runner.WebApp/
└── Zat.Tests.Runner.NUnitTestRunnerProxy/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Keep the glossary general

A term defines a role and the rule that governs it, not the values that happen to exist today.
Enumerating current values (severities, sources, statuses) copies the code into prose that goes
stale on the next commit. Name the type or constant that holds the values and let the reader follow
it.
